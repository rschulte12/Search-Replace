# Search-Replace

The goal of this project is to implement a program that allows a user to gather information about a file and modify it easily. The program is designed to accept user input through console commands. The program has two use cases which are count and replace.

The program can be executed via a Linux bash shell and navigating to the folder in which the java files were downloaded. The files SearchReplace.java, replace.java, and wordcount.java are required to be in the same folder before compiling. Executing “javac SearchReplace.java” will compile the program. Entering “java SearchReplace” will launch the program. When entering a filename, the user may include a file path or may just enter the file name if it is located in the same directory as the program.
